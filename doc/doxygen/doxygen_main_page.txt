\mainpage Universal Simulator Base Library (usbase) 
This document describes the usbase library which can be used to create plug-in libraries for the Universal Simulator.

The library is a collection of C++ header and source files. To create a plug-in derive your own maker class from UniSim::ModelMakerPlugIn 
or UniSim::ControlMakerPlugIn. A maker class is a factory which can manufacture either UniSim::Model or UniSim::Controller objects. 

Derive your own classes from UniSim::Model and UniSim::Controller to define the desired functionality.
